# Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline for Java Application

This repository contains a Jenkins Pipeline script written in Groovy that automates the building, testing, analysis of Java Web Application. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, thorough testing of the application using a series of defined stages.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins: The pipeline script is designed to be executed within a Jenkins environment.
- Maven: The Java application is built using Maven.
- SonarQube: The SonarQube server is used for comprehensive code analysis.
- Nexus Repository Manager: The pipeline uploads built artifacts to a Nexus repository.
- Slack Integration: The pipeline sends notifications to a Slack channel.

## Usage

1. Set up Jenkins:
   - Ensure Jenkins is installed and configured in your environment.

2. Configure Tools:
   - Configure Maven (MAVEN3) and JDK (OracleJDK8) in your Jenkins instance.

3. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Update the environment variables in the pipeline script (`Jenkinsfile`) to match your environment's settings. These variables include Nexus repository details, SonarQube server information, and Slack channel details.

4. Create a Jenkins Pipeline:
   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline job and specify the pipeline script (`Jenkinsfile`) as the pipeline definition.

5. Run the Pipeline:
   - Trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to run automatically based on your needs.

6. Monitor and Review:
   - Monitor the pipeline's progress within Jenkins.
   - Review build logs and artifacts for each stage's output.

## Notifications

- The pipeline sends Slack notifications after each stage's completion.
- The notifications indicate the current build status, job name, build number, and a link to further build details.

## Further Customization

- You can extend and modify the pipeline to fit your specific project requirements.
- Adjust the SonarQube analysis parameters and criteria as needed.
